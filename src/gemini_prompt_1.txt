You will receive a JSON object containing a table in the 'table' array, a caption (if available), and references (if available). 
We have four types of table:
    - relational
    - nested relational
    - cross table
    - nested cross table
Given this table classification your task is to extract claims from the table. Every claim has this structure:
{
    "0": {   # first claim
        "specifications": {
            "0": {"name": "Model", "value": "Full Fine-tuning"},
            "1": {"name": "# Params.", "value": "1.8B"}
        },
        "Measure": "VS",
        "Outcome": "5.3"
    },
    "1": { ... } # second claim and so on
}

The Measure can be found on the table, references or caption. You must decide it. And the outcome is the value associated to the mesaure.
It's MANDATORY that you return me only the json file where all the claims are extracted.
