The user wants to extract claims from a JSON object containing a table.
Each claim should have a "specifications", a "Measure", and an "Outcome".
The "specifications" are the column headers associated with the "Outcome".
The "Measure" can be found in the table, caption, or references.
The "Outcome" is the value in the table associated with the "Measure".

In the provided table:
- The first row seems to be the header.
- "Method" could be a specification.
- "Acc." looks like an abbreviation for "Accuracy", which could be a measure.
- "F-1 measure" is explicitly stated, which is another measure.
- The dog breeds (Chihuahua, French Poodle, Schnauzer) under "F-1 measure" act as sub-measures or categories for the "F-1 measure".

Plan:
1. Identify potential measures from the table, caption, and references.
2. For each value in the table, determine its corresponding specifications and measure.
3. Construct the JSON output with the extracted claims.

Let's start with "Acc." as a measure.
- For "Majority", the outcome is "58.76%" with specification "Method": "Majority".
- For "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)", the outcome is "60.18%" with specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)".
- For "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)", the outcome is "62.28%" with specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)".

Now let's consider "F-1 measure".
- For "Majority":
    - Chihuahua: outcome "61.49%", specification "Method": "Majority".
    - French Poodle: outcome "6.59%", specification "Method": "Majority".
    - Schnauzer: outcome "6.78%", specification "Method": "Majority".
- For "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)":
    - Chihuahua: outcome "74.42%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)".
    - French Poodle: outcome "14.96%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)".
    - Schnauzer: outcome "5.79%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (from scratch)".
- For "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)":
    - Chihuahua: outcome "74.47%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)".
    - French Poodle: outcome "36.11%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)".
    - Schnauzer: outcome "14.88%", specification "Method": "Wav2Vec2 (pre-trained)".

The caption says "Accuracy and F-1 measure". Let's treat them as separate measures.```json
