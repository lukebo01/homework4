The user wants to extract claims from a table given in a JSON format. Each claim should have a "specifications", "Measure", and "Outcome".

The "specifications" will be key-value pairs from the table headers and row headers.
The "Measure" can be found in the table, caption, or references. In this case, the caption clearly states "Identification Accuracies".
The "Outcome" is the value associated with the "Measure" for each row.

Plan:
1. Identify the Measure from the caption.
2. Iterate through each row of the table (starting from the second row as the first row seems to be the header).
3. For each row, extract the identifier (first element) and the outcome (second element).
4. Construct the "specifications" object.
5. Construct the claim object.```json
