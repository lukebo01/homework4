The user wants to extract claims from a table and its associated caption and references.
Each claim will have a 'specifications', 'Measure' and 'Outcome'.
The 'specifications' are key-value pairs from the table.
The 'Measure' can be found in the table, caption or references.
The 'Outcome' is the value associated with the 'Measure'.

Let's analyze the example table and the expected output format.
The table seems to describe different systems for Dravidian languages.
Each column after the first one represents a language.
Each row represents a characteristic of the systems.
The 'Measure' seems to be related to the 'Best performance' row.

Plan:
1. Identify the 'Measure' from the table.
2. Iterate through the columns (excluding the first one).
3. For each column, extract the 'specifications' from the other rows.
4. Extract the 'Outcome' associated with the 'Measure'.
5. Construct the JSON output.```json
