The user wants to extract claims from a table provided in a JSON format.
Each claim should have a "specifications", "Measure", and "Outcome".
The "specifications" come from the table headers and row values.
The "Measure" can be found in the table, caption, or references.
The "Outcome" is the value associated with the "Measure".
The output must be a JSON object.

Plan:
1. Identify the type of table. This table looks like a relational table with clear headers and data rows.
2. Identify the "Measure". It seems like "Number of Speakers" is the measure in this case.
3. Extract "specifications" and "Outcome" for each row.```json
