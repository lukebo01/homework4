The user wants to extract claims from a JSON object containing a table, caption and references.
Each claim should have a "specifications", "Measure" and "Outcome".
The "specifications" are the column headers and the corresponding values in the table.
The "Measure" can be extracted from the table, caption or references.
The "Outcome" is the cell value associated with the measure.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Identify the table structure and headers:**
   - The table is in `data['table']`.
   - The headers are the first row of the table.

2. **Iterate through the table rows (excluding the header row):**
   - For each row, create a new claim.

3. **Extract "specifications":**
   - Iterate through the column headers and the corresponding cell value in the current row.
   - Create a dictionary for "specifications" with "name" and "value".

4. **Identify "Measure":**
   - Look for potential measures in the caption and references.
   - If no explicit measure is found, use the column headers as potential measures.

5. **Identify "Outcome":**
   - The "Outcome" is the value in the cell associated with the identified "Measure".

6. **Construct the JSON output:**
   - Store each extracted claim in the desired JSON format.

Considering the provided table and the structure of the desired output:
- The rows seem to represent different applications or contexts.
- The columns ('Advantage', 'Disadvantage', 'Challenge', 'Future development') could be potential Measures.
- The 'Application' column can serve as a specification.

Let's refine the "Measure" identification: Since the columns represent different aspects, we can use the column headers as the "Measure" and the corresponding cell value as the "Outcome". The "Application" column will serve as the primary specification.

Steps:

1. Get the table headers.
2. Iterate through the rows, starting from the second row.
3. For each row, the first element is the "Application" which serves as a specification.
4. Iterate through the remaining columns (from 'Advantage' onwards).
5. The column header will be the "Measure".
6. The cell value will be the "Outcome".

Let's consider the "nan" values. We should probably skip the extraction when the "Application" is "nan" to avoid redundant claims.```json
