The user wants to extract claims from a table provided in a JSON format.
Each claim should be a JSON object with a "specifications", "Measure", and "Outcome" field.
The "specifications" field contains key-value pairs extracted from the row headers or column headers that describe the context of the claim.
The "Measure" is a metric mentioned in the table, caption, or references.
The "Outcome" is the value associated with the "Measure".

Based on the example provided and the table structure, it seems like each row represents a set of claims.
The "Method" column can be part of the specifications.
The column headers after "Method" represent the measures.
The values in the cells are the corresponding outcomes.

Plan:
1. Iterate over each row of the table starting from the second row (index 1).
2. For each row, extract the "Method" as a specification.
3. Iterate over the column headers starting from the second column (index 1). These are the measures.
4. For each measure, extract the corresponding value from the current row as the outcome.
5. Construct the claim object for each measure-outcome pair.
6. Return the JSON object containing all the extracted claims.

Considering multi-level column headers:
- Level 0 headers might specify the type of measure.
- Level 1 headers might specify the sub-category of the measure.```json
