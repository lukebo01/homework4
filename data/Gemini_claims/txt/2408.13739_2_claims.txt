The user wants to extract claims from a given JSON object containing a table, caption, and references.
The claims should be structured as a JSON object where each claim has a "specifications", "Measure", and "Outcome".
The "specifications" are extracted from the table headers. The "Measure" can be found in the table, caption, or references. The "Outcome" is the value associated with the measure.

The input table is:
```
[['nan', 'LT', 'LT', 'CT', 'CT'],
 ['nan', 'Train', 'Test', 'Train', 'Test'],
 ['Total no. of Male Speakers', '21', '3', '20', '6'],
 ['Total no. of Female Speakers', '43', '12', '37', '15']]
```
The caption is: "Table 2:  Details of the Speech Corpus - Male and Female speakers in Train and Test set"
The references contain information about the data.

Let's identify the claims based on the table structure.
The first row seems to indicate categories (LT and CT) and the second row indicates sub-categories (Train and Test).
The subsequent rows are the actual data.

Claim 1: Total no. of Male Speakers for LT Train is 21.
Claim 2: Total no. of Male Speakers for LT Test is 3.
Claim 3: Total no. of Male Speakers for CT Train is 20.
Claim 4: Total no. of Male Speakers for CT Test is 6.
Claim 5: Total no. of Female Speakers for LT Train is 43.
Claim 6: Total no. of Female Speakers for LT Test is 12.
Claim 7: Total no. of Female Speakers for CT Train is 37.
Claim 8: Total no. of Female Speakers for CT Test is 15.

Let's look for potential measures in the caption and references.
The caption mentions "Details of the Speech Corpus - Male and Female speakers in Train and Test set".
The references mention "total duration", "efficiency of the dialect identification system", "mean and variance of the duration".

Let's start by considering the number of speakers as the measure.

For the claim about "Total no. of Male Speakers" in "LT Train", the specifications would be the combination of column headers that lead to this value.
Specifications for claim 1: {"0": {"name": "Category", "value": "LT"}, "1": {"name": "Set", "value": "Train"}, "2": {"name": "Speaker Gender", "value": "Male"}}

Measure for claim 1: "Total no. of Speakers"
Outcome for claim 1: 21

Let's refine the specifications and the measure based on the table structure.

Specifications could be based on the column headers.
The column headers are effectively:
Column 1: nan nan
Column 2: LT Train
Column 3: LT Test
Column 4: CT Train
Column 5: CT Test

Row headers are:
Row 3: Total no. of Male Speakers
Row 4: Total no. of Female Speakers

Claim structure:
{
    "specifications": {
        "0": {"name": "Category", "value": "LT"},
        "1": {"name": "Set", "value": "Train"},
        "2": {"name": "Speaker Gender", "value": "Male"}
    },
    "Measure": "Number of Speakers",
    "Outcome": "21"
}

Let's iterate over the table to extract all claims.```json
