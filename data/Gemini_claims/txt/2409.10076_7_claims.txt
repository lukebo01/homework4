The user wants to extract claims from a table represented in a JSON object.
Each claim should have a "specifications", a "Measure", and an "Outcome".
The specifications are the row header and column header corresponding to the cell.
The Measure needs to be identified from the table, references, or caption.
The Outcome is the value of the cell.

Based on the example, the keys in "specifications" should be numerical indices.

Let's analyze the provided example table:
```
[['System', 'Score', 'FAR', 'FRR'],
 ['paraformer', '0.105', '0.0025', '0.1025'],
 ['+LRDWWS training set', '0.0646', '0.0021', '0.0625'],
 ['+synthetic data', '0.0493', '0.0018', '0.0475']]
```
Column headers: 'System', 'Score', 'FAR', 'FRR'
Row headers: 'paraformer', '+LRDWWS training set', '+synthetic data'

Let's analyze the caption and references to find the Measure.
Caption: 'Table 7 :  Ablation study of Finetuned Paraformer module on the test-A-eval set.'
References: ['Futhermore, we also perform experiments with different data finetune paraformer on test-A eval set, as shown in Table 7. Using the same matching strategy as in Table 5, we can see that finetuning using synthetic data can make the model more adaptable to the dysarthric environment.']

From the column headers, 'Score', 'FAR', and 'FRR' look like potential measures. Let's consider each of them.

For 'Score' as the Measure:
- System 'paraformer' has a Score of '0.105'
- System '+LRDWWS training set' has a Score of '0.0646'
- System '+synthetic data' has a Score of '0.0493'

For 'FAR' as the Measure:
- System 'paraformer' has a FAR of '0.0025'
- System '+LRDWWS training set' has a FAR of '0.0021'
- System '+synthetic data' has a FAR of '0.0018'

For 'FRR' as the Measure:
- System 'paraformer' has a FRR of '0.1025'
- System '+LRDWWS training set' has a FRR of '0.0625'
- System '+synthetic data' has a FRR of '0.0475'

It seems like we need to extract claims for each of the 'Score', 'FAR', and 'FRR' as measures.

Let's start with 'Score' as the measure.```json
