The user wants to extract claims from a JSON object containing a table, caption, and references.
The claims should be in a JSON format like this:
```json
{
  "0": {
    "specifications": {
      "0": {"name": "Column A Name", "value": "Row 1 Value in Column A"},
      "1": {"name": "Column B Name", "value": "Row 1 Value in Column B"}
    },
    "Measure": "Some Measure (from table, caption or references)",
    "Outcome": "Corresponding value to the Measure"
  },
  "1": { ... }
}
```
The `Measure` can be found in the table, caption, or references.
The `Outcome` is the value associated with the `Measure`.

Let's break down the input table:

```
[['Unnamed: 0', 'Training set', 'Test set'],
 ['Number of samples (all)', '5525.0', '4730.0'],
 ['Number of samples (four emotions)', '2577.0', '2923.0'],
 ['Baseline accuracy (GPT3.5-turbo)', '44.7', '55.18'],
 ['Baseline accuracy (traditional)', '62.34', '51.08']]
```

The column headers are 'Unnamed: 0', 'Training set', and 'Test set'.
The rows represent different metrics.

The caption is: 'Table 4 :  Task-3 dataset statistics and baseline unweighted accuracies (%).'
This suggests "accuracy" as a potential measure and the unit is "%".

The references provide context about the baseline accuracies.

Plan:
1. Iterate through each row of the table (excluding the header row).
2. For each row, the first column can be used as a specification name.
3. The values in the subsequent columns are the outcomes associated with potential measures ('Training set' and 'Test set').
4. Identify potential measures from the caption and the table headers.
5. Construct the claims based on the identified measures and outcomes.```json
