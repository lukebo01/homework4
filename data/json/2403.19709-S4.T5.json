        "We have also performed an ablation on controller RNN architecture. In addition to the IndRNN, we run benchmarks on the standard RNN with t\u200ba\u200bn\u200bh\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\u210etanh activation and Light GRU [27] as controller. The results are summarized in Table 5. IndRNN and Light GRU both are competitive whereas the RNN with t\u200ba\u200bn\u200bh\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\u210etanh activation underperformed. This confirms that the choice of controller architecture is crucial in our HRA adapters."
