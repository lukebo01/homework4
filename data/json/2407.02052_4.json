Our speaker diarization system achieves a diarization error rate (DER) of 10.21%. In comparison to the official baseline, our system achieves a cpCER of 16.31% on the dev set, which relatively improves by 75.3%. Note that there is a difference of smaller than 5% compared to Track 1 with oracle diarization. On the eval set, our system outperforms the official baseline with a relative improvement of 70.5%."
