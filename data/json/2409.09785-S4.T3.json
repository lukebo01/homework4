        "Baseline:\nWe generated the speaker-annotated transcripts from the system proposed in [45] as a baseline system,444https://github.com/tango4j/llm_speaker_tagging based on NeMo [46] speaker diarization and NeMo ASR models. We provide the postprocessing method proposed in [40], where we replace the LLM with n-gram language models. Since the n-gram-based system shows similar results and has low computational demands, we use this n-gram baseline to gauge the performance of beam-search-based speaker tag correction. Fig. 3 shows how beam search decoding can correct the speaker tagging. To mask out acoustic information, the speaker probability values in Fig. 4 are all fixed at 0.96. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the baseline for development and evaluation sets."
