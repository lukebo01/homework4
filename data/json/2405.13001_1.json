        "Roadmap: In Section 2, we briefly introduce the characteristics of LLMs and the education industry, as well as the characteristics of LLMs integrated into education. In Section 3, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the process of applying LLMs to education. In Section 4, we explain the key technologies related to LLMs. In Section 5, we provide the implementation of LLMEdu from the perspective of empowering education with LLMs. In Section 6, we highlight some of the main issues and challenges in LLMEdu. Finally, in Section 7, we summarize LLMEdu and propose expectations for the development of future LLMs. Table 1 describes some basic symbols in this article."
