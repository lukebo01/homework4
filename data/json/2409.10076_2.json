        "We conduct experiments on baseline models using the test-A-eval set, as depicted in Table 2.\nThe baseline model achieves a score of 0.3112. Our proposed system, whether employing the conformer or 2branch-d2v2, consistently outperforms the baseline model.\nSpecifically, 2branch-d2v2 achieves a FAR of 0.0043 and an FRR of 0.0300, demonstrating superior performance compared to the conformer, which records a FAR of 0.0183 and an FRR of 0.0825.\nTherefore, based on these results from the base model selection section, subsequent experiments will focus on 2branch-d2v2."
