        "The LRDWWS dataset comprises 18,630 recordings totaling 17 hours. This includes 10,125 recordings from non-dysarthric speakers (control), amounting to 7.6 hours, and 8,505 recordings from dysarthric speakers (dysarthria), totaling 9.4 hours. The dataset features speech from 21 dysarthric speakers (12 female, 9 male) and 25 non-dysarthric speakers (13 female, 12 male).\nEach speaker contributes 405 recordings, including 50 wake-up word recordings (10 different wake-up words, with 5 recordings per word) and 355 non-wake-up word recordings. The non-wake-up word recordings consist of fixed command words, descriptions of furniture, TV and audio control words, numbers, interactions, and negative samples. Table 1 provides detailed information about the datasets used in training each module."
