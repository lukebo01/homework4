Our system achieves a FAR of 0.003210, an FRR of 0.005000, and a score of 0.008210 on the test-B-eval set. Please note that these results are obtained after incorporating the test-A-eval set into the training process. We can observe that our PDDWS system significantly outperforms the official baseline, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 93.69% and securing first place in the challenge."
